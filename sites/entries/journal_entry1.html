                Another year has passed, I would say it was a bit awful yet a 
                very interesting year for me since there are a lot of things 
                that just happened. Some may be memorable in a good or bad way. 
                I just ruined my sleep schedule and mental health pretty much 
                the whole span of the year. I had a lot on my mind this year, 
                I planned to try and fix myself next year and give a bit of 
                time for my hobbies. Yet, I am excited and a bit scared of what 
                the future will offer to me. All's well that ends, not as 
                bad as it could have!

                I haven't thought much about what would I be in five years. 
                All I know is I have to keep on moving forward just to survive. 
                I thought about entering the IT industry to earn money for a 
                bit and while doing that I would get part-time jobs in the art 
                industry. I enjoy arts and designing websites. I think it's 
                the only thing I'm best at in the industry. Although, I also 
                want to be a game developer so it could be a job I'll be in 
                the future. But it's just an expected outcome for me. Who 
                knows, maybe I might make a turn on arts or do something 
                very different from what I planned. I hope it gets well!
